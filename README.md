# 📂 Python File Organizer

A simple Python automation script that organizes files into folders based on their file extensions.

This project demonstrates the use of Python's built-in file handling libraries to automatically sort files into categorized directories, making folders cleaner and easier to manage.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

Managing folders with hundreds of mixed files can be time-consuming.

This script scans a selected directory, identifies each file's extension, creates a folder for that extension (if it doesn't already exist), and moves the file into the corresponding folder.

For example:

```text
Before:
Downloads/
│
├── report.pdf
├── image.png
├── notes.txt
├── music.mp3
└── project.zip
```

```text
After:
Downloads/
│
├── PDF/
│   └── report.pdf
│
├── PNG/
│   └── image.png
│
├── TXT/
│   └── notes.txt
│
├── MP3/
│   └── music.mp3
│
└── ZIP/
    └── project.zip
```

# 💼 Problem Statement

Folders often become cluttered with files of different types, making it difficult to locate documents quickly.

This project automates file organization by sorting files into extension-based folders.

---

# ⚙️ Features

- Automatically scans a selected folder
- Detects file extensions
- Creates folders for each file type
- Moves files into corresponding folders
- Ignores directories
- Detects files without extensions
- Simple command-line interface
